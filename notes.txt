That’s a strong strategy—establish a solid foundation first, then scale security iteratively. When you're ready to implement:

1)Real-time intrusion logging
2)Geo-location-based anomaly detection
3)Audit-compliant activity tracking
4)JWT or OAuth2-based token hardening
5)CAPTCHA/rate-limit enforcement for endpoints

"Optional Enhancements
Count failed attempts and block after N tries.
Store image and IP in database.
Display alert on admin dashboard (if exists)."
